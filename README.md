## Folder Structure
```markdown
+--- assets             # Folder for media and assets used in the website
│   +--- Font           # Folder for typography
│   │   +--- Alternative files           # Folder for alternative typography

    |-- +--- global     # Global styles applied across the entire website
    |-- +--- variable   #All variables defined in this sass files
